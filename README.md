# PRODIGY_WD_05
A minimal yet dynamic weather application that fetches real-time meteorological data using the OpenWeatherMap API and renders it with an adaptive UI. This project combines functional elegance with responsive design to provide a seamless user experience. <br> <br>
It allows users to query any city worldwide and receive accurate data regarding: <br>
1. Temperature in Celsius <br>
2. Weather condition (rain, snow, clear, etc.) <br>
3. Humidity percentage <br>
4. Wind speed <br>
The interface morphs itself based on the current weather condition, altering its background gradient styling to create an immersive and context-aware visual palette.
(The background gradients are crafted to evoke the emotional tone of each weather type (melancholic drizzle, warm sunshine, icy snow, etc.))

Features: <br>
1. Live City Search: Search any global city to get its current weather instantly <br>
2. Dynamic UI Feedback: Backgrounds and icons change with the weather <br>
3. Error Handling: Notifies users of invalid inputs with graceful fallbacks <br>
4. Responsive Design: Fully adaptable layout across screen sizes<br><br>
